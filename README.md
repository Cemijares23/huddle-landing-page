## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS BEM
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I don't usually fill this section, but i learned with this challenge how to work with rem on media queries, some accesibility features, and how to style a svg element.

I learned that coding also means to make a webpage accesible for everyone with disabilities, and that it's an important part of the process too.

### Continued development

I'll try to add more accesibilty to my websites, since i'm interested on helping make everyone capable of enjoying any kind of content online.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Box-Shadow Samples](https://www.example.com) - Just a site i use for shadows
